# imTCA's osu! Skin List

## ORDER: most used skin/s, owoTuna imTCA Edit, then in order of date added.

## will update as often as i can, but dm me on discord @ imTCA#3060 if a skin is missing (scroll and check first though).

<!-- # also, check the skin folder of a skin if the download link doesn't automatically come with the cursor that you saw me recently use on stream/in videos. (ie: yellow cookiezi cursor with red trail as opposed to no trail). it will probably be there, if not, notify me. -->
